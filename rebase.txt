git rebase master
    --> So whenever we want to take the latest master changes from master in local branch, you need to run this command.
    --> In order to do it, first you have to checkout to bracch --> git checkout vpr
    --> Then run the rebase command.

git fetch
    --> This will just show the changes in the remote repo but it will not pull the file
